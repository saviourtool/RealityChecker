<h1>About RealityCheckr</h1>

<p>RealityCheckr was created to help people pause and make sense of confusing emotional moments.</p>

<p>Instead of long explanations or chat-based interactions, this site offers simple patterns and grounded reflections that help reduce overthinking.</p>

<p>RealityCheckr is not therapy and does not replace professional help. It exists as a calm, neutral space for clarity.</p>
